# Notes

## Spread spectrum modulation

Originally created to provide secure communication over a large frequency band, including preventing jamming and others listening in. You use more bandwidth than the original signal requires, thus 'spreading' the signal accross a frequency spectrum.

### Direct sequence spread spectrum modulation (DSSS)

"Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) introduces rapid phase transition to the data making it larger in bandwidth." [1](https://www.ni.com/en/solutions/aerospace-defense/communications-navigation/understanding-spread-spectrum-for-communications.html)

"... the power density amplitude of the spread spectrum output signal is similar to the noise floor. The signal is “hidden” under the noise." [1](https://www.ni.com/en/solutions/aerospace-defense/communications-navigation/understanding-spread-spectrum-for-communications.html)

By increasing the number of pulses / chips, you also increase the frequency band used in signal. See diagram in [2](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/documentation/tech-papers-and-guides/lora-and-lorawan/)

## LPWAN

"Long range communication or low power wide area net-works (LPWANs) are networks where high data rate require-ments are traded for range and energy improvements. In thesenetworks, data rates are very low, leaving hardly a few bytesper seconds, but enabling ranges of a few kilometers."
