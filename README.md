## Preliminary problem statement
https://itustudent.itu.dk/Study-Administration/Project-Work/the-project-page

LoRa is a proprietary radio communication technology, that excels over long distances, on low power devices, and high noise environments. Other advantages include the fact that it can work in ISM-bands, thus avoiding the need of having a license. Furthermore, on the 2.4GHz ISM band, there is no duty cycle. It is most commonly used in conjunction with LoRaWAN, a low power wide area network, for IoT purposes.
Use cases include monitoring the contents of silos (https://www.loriot.io/use-cases/agritech-silo-monitoring.html) and monitoring air quality in schools (https://www.alliot.co.uk/lorawan-use-cases/) ... (more use cases?). 

LoRa operates at low data rates. This means that while LoRa is very suitable for transmitting small amounts of data generated by sensors to a central server, it is not suitable for the transfer of files. 
We believe that this is a challenge that warrents further investigation, since the transfer of files through LoRa is very relevant in cases where image or audio data is gathered.
Possible uses could be the transfer of various forms of data from sattelites to groundstations, or video and audio monitoring accross a large area on ground.

The goal of this project is to evaluate the feasability of performing file transfer using LoRa on the 2.4 GHz ISM band, taking different possible use cases into consideration. For each use case we will propose software solutions, implement them, and test them in a real setting.



### Previous problem statement

Investigate the challenges and limits of file transfer through LoRa 2.4GHz.
Evaluate effective strategies for file transfer over LoRa 2.4GHz.

Needed at latest feb. 2

## Questions and other notes

Why is it that the bitrate decreases with higher spreading factors? The length of a chirp halves, but symbols per chirp double...

What is the impact of doppler effect and doppler rate on LoRa when communicating with a sattelite in LEO? 
**[See this article](https://semtech.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#E0000000JelG/a/3n000000l9JA/FoIjLVxAx4xpf3Wh5xvvX3B9PWTw.S7R.YPZHazMzBo)** and **[this one](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356713129_The_influence_of_LEO_satellite_Doppler_effect_on_LoRa_modulation_and_its_solutio)**


What is the background noise power in different situations (e.g. in the case of sattelite communication)? This is necessary to calculate signal to noise ratio, which affects symbol error rate... 

Related to the two above, which combination of spreading factor and bandwidth will result in the most transmitted information?
