# Abstract

LoRa is a spread spectrum modulation that sacrifices data rate in exchange for range. It provides the physical layer for LoRaWAN, a wide area network used in IoT. 
Files transfer is very rarely, if ever, performed over a LoRa physical layer, due to the low data rate. 
We implement a protocol, to perform point-to-point transmission of files. We then perform file transfer, between 2 LoRa transceivers on the 2.4GHz ISM band at various distances. Experiments show a data rate of ___ bits per second over a range of ______ km.
This means that performing file transfer over LoRa is feasible, and also useful in cases where file sizes a small enough.
