# Abstract

## First draft

LoRa is a spread spectrum modulation that sacrifices data rate in exchange for range. It provides the physical layer for LoRaWAN, a wide area network used in IoT. 
Files transfer is very rarely, if ever, performed over a LoRa physical layer, due to the low data rate. 
We implement a protocol, to perform point-to-point transmission of files. We then perform file transfer, between 2 LoRa transceivers on the 2.4GHz ISM band at various distances. Experiments show a data rate of ___ bits per second over a range of ______ km.
This means that performing file transfer over LoRa is feasible, and also useful in cases where file sizes a small enough.

## Second draft

This paper evaluates the feasability of using LoRa on the 2.4gHz ISM band for file transfer. LoRa, a spread spectrum modulation, is most often used as the physical layer for LoRaWAN, in cases where small amounts of data are transferred from accross a wide area to a central server. Due to the low data rate, file transfer is very rarely, if ever, performed over LoRa.
We implement a simple protocol for file transfer between 2 LoRa transceivers. The protocol ensures that the complete file is transmitted, even in the face of lost frames. Using this protocol we successfully perform file transfer of a file 50kb large, over a distance of 4km over a period of 20 minutes. 
This shows that LoRa point-to-point file transfer, although slow, is feasible. It is suited for use cases where ...
